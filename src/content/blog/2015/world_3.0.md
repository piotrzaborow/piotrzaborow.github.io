One day I was asked on Twitter by [@mtarnawska](https://twitter.com/mtarnawska) to answer the questions from a text below.

> “We live in time of new media. In World 2.0. We barely remember the world before, but it’s still in our memory. The World 1.0 — the world of telegrams, letters; the world without phones, the Internet or other technologies of our times. We are probably the last generation that will remember this breakthrough.
>
> If World 1.0 is fully analogue and World 2.0 is fully interactive, so… if you had a chance to create an arcadia of World 3.0, which parts of the previous worlds would you mix?
>
> Which elements would you leave? Do you miss telegrams or letters? Is it possible to set any restraint? Should we humanize the machine or robotize the human?”

I am a geek, a programmer and a gamer. All of it is based on the World 2.0. I remember the whole process of the upgrade. It happened during my childhood. As a child I perceived everything around me in a different way than now. Everything just happened and I thought that it was not a big deal. Present kids thought in the same way… but they don’t remember the past and, what is worst, they are not interested in it at all.

Now, I can see it because I have the younger siblings (6-year-old brother and 13-year-old sister). Both of them remember only the World 2.0, the world in which we live nowadays. It can be shocking, but kids from a primary school and a junior high school don’t know how 2,5” floppy disk or cassette look like. Even though that there are computers and video players for such media. They cannot imagine the world of the past. They just can’t and nobody demands that they have to. We are preparing youngers for the future without showing them not so distant past. They will ask questions themselves when there will want to. They leave our past behind. They don’t want to miss anything that is not cool anymore.

But I have something that I really miss. Letters. They were cool in the past. And now they are forgotten. I also write not as much as I really want to. I miss that writing a letter is now without any sense. E-mail is faster and we got our delivery notifications suddenly. Or maybe is different? In the past letter wasn’t something special, and this days we are sending them only in particular situations. I miss it.

I noticed it two years ago, when I sent a love letter to my (past) beloved. I shed all my feelings on paper. I didn’t think. I wrote until there weren’t any blank space left on a sheet of paper. It was magical. Later, when I got the response letter, I felt incredibly.

While opening that letter I felt uncertainty. While reading it I felt curiosity. While hiding to the envelope, I felt that strong desire to keep it in secret.

It was magical and but now it it forgotten.

It’s the same feeling with old photos. I’ve recently had time to view my photo albums which contain photos taken 10 years ago. I laughed and cried at the same time. I felt that amazing feeling and I had a desire to see more. You know why? Because there are only a few of them. One photo stores a lot of emotions, which we miss now. In the past we were limited only to graphic art film. We wanted to take as much good pictures as we could. Nowadays, we just take our smartphones or digital cameras with big amount of memory capacity. They are too big for John Smith. He are able to take 1000 photos from 14-day-long trip. These pictures will never be (or barely ever) seen again.

Everything is just gone.

Analogue times are gone and now we live in the digital world. Everything we know in the past has its equivalent in this new era. But can we feel it in the same way like in the past? In my opinion… no. We lack the emotions from the analogue world.

Think about your curiosity. How often are you really curious about something? Probably quite often. How often and how fast do you use the Internet to fulfill it? I bet that pretty often and pretty fast — faster than you can imagine. Is it good? Of course it is not. Our curiosity should be fulfilled step by step. Only then we can feel complete.
Everything we know is built because of our curiosity but also this curiosity is killed slowly. Curiosity defines us as humans. Thanks to that we become creative and have a desire to explore the world.

We are becoming the emotionless robots, with defined purposes and we strive to fulfill them with the easiest and the fastest ways. I don’t want to become a machine. I don’t want this kind of the world 3.0.

The world of the future should mix the past with present. The mixture of feelings and productivity. At the same time we should draw the exact boundary, define exactly who is a man and what is a machine. Machine should start to challenge us and these challenges should awake our curiosity (but it should not become a man). Thanks to that we will start again to search, but on our own. We will try to do something by ourselves. We will be humans once again. This boundary is as much important for our generation as for all future generations.

My generation is probably the last that saw the end of the analogue era and the rise of the digital one. We can be the only people who can tell how everything looked like in the past and also the one who will create the future.
Everything depends on us.

The World 3.0 depends on us.
